Project in PHP 5.5 / MySQL5 from Benjamin JÃ¶ckel

This is a simple implementation (done in less than 24 hours) of a MySQL5 database editor.

The user can:
 1. create a new table and add columns to this table.
 2. delete tables.
 3. Empty tables.
 4. View a summary of all tables.
 5. Add rows to tables.
 6. View a report of all people in the database.
 
Features:
1. Report used prepared MySQL statements for performance. 
2. Duplicate rows are rejected.

Obviously this code is far from elegant. It was a speed test.
